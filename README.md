Here is a more detailed step-by-step guide to help you create the FPS Microgame with the Xion .NET SDK integration:

Install Unity Hub from the Unity website (https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download) and install the latest Unity version. Sign in or create a new Unity account.

Download the FPS Microgame template from the Unity Learn website (https://learn.unity.com/project/fps-template). Unzip the downloaded folder to a location on your computer.

Open Unity Hub and click the "Add" button. Navigate to the unzipped FPS Microgame folder and select it. The FPS Microgame project should now appear in the Unity Hub "Projects" list. Click on the project to open it in Unity.

Import the Xion .NET SDK into your Unity project:
a. Download the SDK from the GitHub repository (https://github.com/xion-global/Xion-DotNet-SDK).
b. Unzip the folder.
c. In Unity, click "Assets" -> "Import Package" -> "Custom Package."
d. Navigate to the unzipped Xion .NET SDK folder and select the .unitypackage file.
e. Click "Import" in the Import Unity Package window.

Install the required dependencies:
a. Nethereum.Unity:
i. Download the package from https://github.com/Nethereum/Nethereum/tree/master/src/Nethereum.Unity.
ii. In Unity, click "Assets" -> "Import Package" -> "Custom Package."
iii. Navigate to the downloaded Nethereum.Unity folder and select the .unitypackage file.
iv. Click "Import" in the Import Unity Package window.
b. Newtonsoft.Json:
i. Open the Asset Store in Unity by clicking "Window" -> "Asset Store."
ii. Search for "Json.NET for Unity" or visit https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/input-management/json-net-for-unity-11347.
iii. Click "Import" or "Download" and then "Import" in the Import Unity Package window.

In the Assets folder, locate the "Scenes" folder, and open the "MainMenu" scene.

Add a new button:
a. In the Hierarchy window, right-click on the "Canvas" object and select "UI" -> "Button."
b. Rename the new button to "BuyGunButton" by clicking on it in the Hierarchy window and changing its name in the Inspector window.
c. Change the button's text by expanding the "BuyGunButton" object in the Hierarchy window, clicking on the "Text" object, and modifying the "Text" field in the Inspector window.

Create a new C# script:
a. In the Assets folder, right-click and select "Create" -> "C# Script."
b. Name the script "GunPurchaseManager" and press Enter.
c. Double-click the script in the Assets folder to open it in a code editor.

Implement the GunPurchaseManager script as described in the previous guide, starting with adding the necessary namespaces and continuing with the implementation of the required methods.

Save the script in the code editor and return to Unity.

In Unity, create an empty game object:
a. Right-click in the Hierarchy window and select "Create Empty."
b. Rename the new object to "GunPurchaseManager."

Attach the "GunPurchaseManager" script to the new game object:
a. In the Inspector window, click "Add Component."
b. Search for "GunPurchaseManager" and select it.

Assign the "BuyGunButton" to the "GunPurchaseManager" script:
a. In the Inspector window, locate the "Gun Purchase Manager" component attached to the "GunPurchaseManager" game object.
b. Click and drag the "BuyGunButton" object from the Hierarchy window to the "Buy Gun Button" field in the "Gun Purchase Manager" component in the Inspector window.

Create a new script called "PlayerInventory":
a. In the Assets folder, right-click and select "Create" -> "C# Script."
b. Name the script "PlayerInventory" and press Enter.
c. Double-click the script in the Assets folder to open it in a code editor.
d. Add a method to add the purchased gun to the inventory.

Save the "PlayerInventory" script in the code editor and return to Unity.

In Unity, locate the "Player" prefab in the "Prefabs" folder.

Attach the "PlayerInventory" script to the "Player" prefab:
a. Click on the "Player" prefab to open it in the Inspector window.
b. Click "Add Component."
c. Search for "PlayerInventory" and select it.

Update the "PlayerWeapons" script to reference the new gun from the "PlayerInventory" script:
a. Open the "PlayerWeapons" script in a code editor.
b. Modify the script to retrieve the purchased gun from the "PlayerInventory" script and assign it to the player.

Save the "PlayerWeapons" script in the code editor and return to Unity.

Test the FPS Microgame:
a. In Unity, click on the "Play" button at the top center of the window.
b. The game should start in the "MainMenu" scene.
c. Click on the "Buy Gun" button and follow the MetaMask prompts to approve the USDT transaction.
d. Once the transaction is complete, the gun should be added to the player's inventory, and the player should be able to use the gun in the game.

Now you should have a fully functional FPS Microgame with the ability to purchase a gun asset using USDT with the Xion .NET SDK.
